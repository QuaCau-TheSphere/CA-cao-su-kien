Số 12, Thảo Điền, TP Thu Duc, Hồ Chí Minh 713388\n\n**Larger series:** Join us for an insightful events delving into the fascinating world of psychology and its applications to everyday life. Whether you are curious about cognitive processes, behavior patterns, or the complexities of the human mind, this event is designed to provide a deeper understanding of how psychology can be used to enhance various aspects of our lives.\n\n**Topic for this meeting:** As the great Vietnamese Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh has said, “You have an appointment with life, an appointment that is in the here and now.” The profoundity of such words cannot be overstated. However, no matter how many times we hear it, our mind seems to draw us into endless labrynth of distractions from this life-saving and life-affirming fact. For, where else could happiness be found if not in the here and now? Where else will life ever be? In this meeting we explore this question and see how psychology can help illuminate and support our aspirations to keep this appointment.\n\n**Agenda for meeting:** We will explore the topic first with a brief talk by clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, & founder of the Center for Wisdom Psychology. As part of the talk he will outline some practical tools that people can use to cultivate greater self-knowledge in their lives. Then, we will get a chance to apply what we learned in fun, structured exercises in smaller groups of 2 or 3. We will close with a larger discussion, and time for questions and comments.\n\n**Who is it for:** This event is free and open to all interested in the topic. The event offers a unique opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and gain valuable insights that can positively impact your personal growth and development. Whether you have a background in psychology or are simply interested in learning more about the subject, this event is sure to inspire and enlighten you.",
