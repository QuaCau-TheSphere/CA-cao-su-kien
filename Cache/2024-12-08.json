Whether you are curious about cognitive processes, behavior patterns, or the complexities of the human mind, this event is designed to provide a deeper understanding of how psychology can be used to enhance various aspects of our lives.\n\n**Topic for this meeting:** Self-Acceptance is like a balm for the soul. Most of us feel, often unconsciously and unknowingly, that we are not fundamentally okay the way we and that we need to be some way other than how we are. This non-acceptance of ourselves can act as a barrier to our natural sense of well-being, happiness, & enjoyment of life. It may be true or wise to want healing or seek to improve ourselves in one way or another. But if what we seek to improve is confused for who we fundamentally are, we wage a subtle war with ourselves. Self-acceptance is the opposite; it is the medicine. It provides the grounds for healing, genuineness, & inner freedom.\n\n**Agenda for meeting:** We will explore the topic first with a discussion and brief talk by clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, & founder of the Center for Wisdom Psychology. As part of the talk he will outline some practical tools that people can use to cultivate the topic under discussion in their lives. Then, we will get a chance to apply what we learned in fun, structured exercises in smaller groups of 2 or 3. We will close with a larger discussion, and time for questions and comments.\n\n**Who is it for:** This event is free and open to all interested in the topic. The event offers a unique opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and gain valuable insights that can positively impact your personal growth and development. Whether you have a background in psychology or are simply interested in learning more about the subject, this event is sure to inspire and enlighten you.",
