Số 12, Thảo Điền, TP Thu Duc, Hồ Chí Minh 713388\n\n**Larger series:** Join us for an insightful events delving into the fascinating world of psychology and its applications to everyday life. Whether you are curious about cognitive processes, behavior patterns, or the complexities of the human mind, this event is designed to provide a deeper understanding of how psychology can be used to enhance various aspects of our lives.\n\n**Topic for this meeting:** As the great Vietnamese Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh has said, “You have an appointment with life, an appointment that is in the here and now.” The profoundity of such words cannot be overstated. However, no matter how many times we hear it, our mind seems to draw us into endless labrynth of distractions from this life-saving and life-affirming fact. For, where else could happiness be found if not in the here and now? Where else will life ever be? In this meeting we explore this question and see how psychology can help illuminate and support our aspirations to keep this appointment.\n\n**Agenda for meeting:** We will explore the topic first with a brief talk by clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, & founder of the Center for Wisdom Psychology. As part of the talk he will outline some practical tools that people can use to cultivate greater self-knowledge in their lives. Then, we will get a chance to apply what we learned in fun, structured exercises in smaller groups of 2 or 3. We will close with a larger discussion, and time for questions and comments.\n\n**Who is it for:** This event is free and open to all interested in the topic. The event offers a unique opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and gain valuable insights that can positively impact your personal growth and development. Whether you have a background in psychology or are simply interested in learning more about the subject, this event is sure to inspire and enlighten you.",

      "môTả": "**About the Group:** This group is a gathering of curious minds and seekers dedicated to the exploration of life’s most fundamental questions: *What is the nature of reality? Who are we? Why do we exist? What does it mean to be?* Our discussions and practices draw from the vast and rich tapestry of the world's philosophical, metaphysical, contemplative, spiritual, and scientific traditions—spanning East and West, ancient to modern.\n\n**Topic for this meeting:** This will be the inaugural meeting for this meetup group. We kick-off the group be engaging with various questions and exercises to connect with a sense of wonder.\n\n**Agenda for meeting:** We begin our meetings with some warm-up questions in small groups of 2-3, then move into a brief talk, which acts as a spring-board for later inquiry. After the talk, we again gather in small groups of 2-3 to discuss exploration questions, then come back together to share, and finally aim to have at least 30 minutes at the end for free-form socializing for those who want to.\n\n**Who is it for:** Whether you are a seasoned scholar, a spiritual practitioner, or simply someone intrigued by life’s biggest questions, this group is a welcoming space for exploration, dialogue, and discovery. Join us as we journey through the landscapes of thought and being, together seeking to illuminate the profound depths of existence.",
